# Reddit-stock-market-sentiment-analysis
This repo attempts to correlate the sentiment of posts/commets of the WallStreetBets subreddit to the volatility of popular stocks.
In this project, the goal is to investigate the presence of mispricing in option markets and its
underlying causes. More in particular, a possible candidate for implied volatility
movements, namely the subreddit r/WallStreetBets, is investigated through sentiment analysis,
and its correlation with IV is tested and conclusions
are to be drawn concerning the impact that r/WallStreetBets has on option mispricing.

Whereas there are plentiful studies analyzing the relationship existing
between the stock sentiment on well-known platforms such as Google and Twitter and financial
markets/indices (see Mao, Counts, and Bollen (2011)), there is a significant lack of research
conducted on r/WallStreetBets, a platform which is nevertheless increasingly affecting the world
of Finance. Hence, the project will aim to provide an answer to this gap by employing a novel
database of the 50 most popular S&P 500 stocks on the platform throughout 2021.
In terms of results, the project does not find statistical evidence in favour of an effect of
r/WallStreetBetsâ€™ sentiment on Implied Volatility. At the same time, the results are neverthless
able to provide insights for both industry (due to the economic significance of the L/S strategy
implemented) and academia (by analyzing, empirically, one of the most influential yet overlooked
trends of recent years: r/WallStreetBets).
